# 'blue candle' # we seem to play this correctly without it being implemented because game adjusts the state correctly.
# we should adjust the comparisons a bit to make sure we're more aggressively exhausting curses when this is available.
# 'calipers'

# 'dead branch'
# 'ectoplasm'  could take it into account when we do clever finishers for not caring about hand of gold
# 'meat on the bone'

# 'sacred bark'
# 'dolly's mirror'
# 'ssserpent head' should go into map handler I guess
# 'brimstone' - probaly need to be more aggressive when we have this
